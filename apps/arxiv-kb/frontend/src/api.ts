/**
 * Resolve the API base URL for this app.

 * Uses same-origin relative path by default — works automatically in:
 * - Private App mode (served at :8800, API at :8800/api/app/{shortcode}/)
 * - standalone mode (served at :880X, API at :880X/api/app/{shortcode}/)
 *
 * The browser resolves relative paths against the current origin,
 * so no configuration needed for different ports.
 *
 * Build-time override: set VITE_API_BASE for custom deployments.
